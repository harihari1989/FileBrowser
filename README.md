FileBrowser
===========

Takes a part of file name which you want to open as input and searches it across all directories under current directory
and displays all of the files which match the name provided, enabling the user to select which file he intended to open,
I used a shell utility called dialog for the User Interface.

Usage:

python filefinder.py [filepath] [filename_to_be_searched_and_opened] [texteditor_to_open]
